Diffusion Monte Carlo project used to solve the Schrodinger equation in 1D and 2D for the infinite potential wells. This uses random walks in the same method as the heat equation for classical physics.

Despite being a Monte Carlo method applied to quantum mechanics, this is not quantum DMC.

The pdf is the result of the project: this is currently (as of 17/08/24) my most recent written research project. This should display a better programming and writing ability than my ionospheric physics project.
